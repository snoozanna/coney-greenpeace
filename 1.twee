  <p>Greenpeace were founded in 1971 as a meeting of two existing movements for change:
    the climate movement: giving us 'green' and the anti-war movement: where we get peace 'peace'.</p>

   <p> it's a meeting of Greenpeace and Coney.
  </p>
  
 <p> It brings Greenpeace's work as climate campaigners and Coney's work as playful activists together: Playful Climate Activism </p>
  /
  <p>Coney & Greenpeace have worked together before, on a piece of Playful Activism. </p>

<p>Mya-Rose has covered a lot – the drastic inequality of those who are living with the impacts of the climate crisis yet causing the least pollution. And we’ve heard lots about palm oil too…like lots of things, the raw ingredient of palm oil itself isn’t bad, but when it’s commercially extracted (like Unilever do) that’s when we get 250,000 football pitches worth of deforestation. </p>

<p>Thanks Mya-Rose. </p>
<p>We’ll move on in a moment, but before we do, let’s reflect on what we’ve just heard.</p> 
<p>A lot of that was closer to home, maybe it shifted something for you. </p>
<p>Some questions you might ask</p>
<ul>
<li>  -	Did you think the climate emergency and racism were linked before? </li>
 <li> -	What did you think about Mya-Rose’s thoughts on collective over individualistic action?</li>

We play games of systems not to reduce them, not to suggest they are unreal, not to forget the violence they cause.</p>
<p>We play games of systems because games can change.</p>
<p>
  When we play a game of a system, this shows us that systems can change too.
  We can mod a system to create a different one.
</p>
<p>When we know what we're trying to build, the kind of system we want to create, we can use this to guide us.</p>
/* / */

<p>We can use games to look to the future, to imagine how things could be different.</p>
<p>Games can also remind us how flawed and broken things are. Like the extraction economy game did in our last session. </p>
<p>They can remind us that we're living in a system that destroys our Earth by pulling things out of it.</p>
<p>That this system serves those with power. </p>

<p>And changing games reminds us that things can be different.</p>
<p>It reminds us that change is possible.</p>

    <p>  Hello. </p>
<p>Glad you got into the next component! </p>
<p>Here we are then – ready to play.</p>
<p>Working towards a Playful Action. </p>
<p>Inspired by Codename: Violet. </p>
<p>I should probably explain more about how Codename: Violet started, seeing as we are starting our action too. I’ll sum it up in 32 seconds. </p>
/
<p>Codename: Violet was run by a group of 8-10 year olds who Coney work with. We call them the Young Coneys, because, well it’s simple really, they work with Coney & they are young. They make play about the stuff they are passionate about. They’re Playful Activists too. In fact, they started all this Playful Activism stuff for us. Codename: Violet did. </p>
/
<p>It all started with an email from Greenpeace to Coney. </p>
<p>(in a fake voice 1) Do you know any kids who might want to be involved in our Ditch Diesel Campaign?</p>
<p>(in a fake voice 2) What’s that? </p>
<p>(in a fake voice 1) A campaign about Air Pollution & Diesel cars. </p>
<p>(in a fake voice 2) Yep, maybe, but what would they do? </p>
<p>(in a fake voice 1) We want them to come up with a plan. We’ll help but we want you to design it. Make it using their skills. </p>
/
<p>Great voices Kai – thanks everyone. </p>

<p>When we can see power, and how its all connected, we know which domino to knock over </p>

<p>Welcome back. </p>
<p>Today is all about making </p>
<p>Making can mean many different things. </p>
<p>It might mean building something </p>
<p>But it also might mean writing something, rehearsing something, </p>
<p>perhaps recording something, or assembling something, or even dismantling something</p>
/* /  */
<p>It has to do with something. </p>
/* / */
<p>It’ll all depend on what your action is, and the gift you’re giving </p>
<p>For Violet we knew the young coneys were going to be very junior doctors, but when we got to making we had to work out what that meant: Would we give consultations? Would we operate on someone? Would we deliver public service announcements? Would we do all 3?</p>
<p>We began making by writing. We wrote a script for those very junior doctors </p>
<p>And then we rehearsed: we practiced our roles, what we were going to say, how to have the conversations we wanted (and needed) to have </p>
/* / */
<p>Your making might look like this </p>
<p>It might be something very different </p>
<p>If I can make one suggestion though - </p>
<p>It’s to hold onto the playful in playful activist </p>
<p>What are you playing and who is getting to play? </p>
<p>How is playfulness your attitude? </p>
/* / */
<p>And then next session, YES next session </p>
<p>You’ll deliver your gift to its recipient </p>
<p>I’ve got chills </p>
<p>Not really but I am excited </p>
<p>I hope you are too </p>
<p>Before we let you, and your Artist, of the creative leash, we need to chat about hats. </p>
